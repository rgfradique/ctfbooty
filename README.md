# Just another CTF Discord bot

Quick and dirty discord bot made for our CTF Team. Largely inspired by other similar bots, created due to how awkward some where to use.
Basic features include:
- Create a CTF Role that players can add or remove themselves from, to notify all interested players when a CTF is starting
- Create, delete, and archive a CTF channel
- Create and delete challenge threads inside each CTF channel, and mark them as solved/unsolved
- List all current challenges in that particular CTF

Will probably contain bugs, errors, and issues.
No guarantees that it won't mess up your server, only being tested in a trusted environment (as in, we can trust our users)
